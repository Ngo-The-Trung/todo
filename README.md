TODO
- Remove the test binaries
- Add a command to initialize the tables
  - And perhaps a command to drop the tables too
- Queries:
  - What did I do yesterday?
  - What have I done last month?
  - What have I done last quarter?
  - Last year?
  - Range?
- Command to change parent_id
- When creating a task, I think I should start with a note immediately
- Better output format. For starter, each note should be properly separated
- "leaves" should have optional depth parameter
